# expo-typescript

Just a sample hello-world Expo project with:

- Expo SDK >= 31
- Babel 7
- Typescript
- Jest
- ./src root
- Support for `.android.tsx` and `.ios.tsx`
- Predefined `tsconfig.json` and `tslint.json`

Please don't hesitate to contribute or report anything that could be improved, as I'm a TS newbie I probably could have done something wrong.
